mqtt real time data collection system and plotting

idea is to use sensors + microcontroller send data to a broker (Rbpi) and broker to the consumer(phone app)

micro controler and sensor can be easy. Broker has hardware, need to learn software(maybe in JS or python). consumer needs android app in react

services needed """
sends commands on/off to light/server motor
read data lines from a csv file in real time
access historical data
plot csv files into a graph
access all this on a phone, maybe expand to a web page later
"""
steps

1) create phone app with react native, basic functionality is communicating with mqtt broker, being subbed to topics and looking at raw csv files

2) create mqtt broker and upload on raspberry pi, creating topics, and communicating with all parties

3) create mqtt publisher, all functions just return a string for now
